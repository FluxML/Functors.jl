Optionally, it may also be associated with objects ys with the same tree structure. In that case, f is applied to the corresponding leaf nodes in x and ys.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> fmap(string, (x=1, y=(2, 3)))\n(x = \"1\", y = (\"2\", \"3\"))\n\njulia> nt = (a = [1,2], b = [23, (45,), (x=6//7, y=())], c = [8,9]);\n\njulia> fmap(println, nt)\n[1, 2]\n23\n45\n6//7\n()\n[8, 9]\n(a = nothing, b = Any[nothing, (nothing,), (x = nothing, y = nothing)], c = nothing)\n\njulia> fmap(println, nt; exclude = x -> x isa Array)\n[1, 2]\nAny[23, (45,), (x = 6//7, y = ())]\n[8, 9]\n(a = nothing, b = nothing, c = nothing)\n\njulia> twice = [1, 2];  # println only acts once on this\n\njulia> fmap(println, (i = twice, ii = 34, iii = [5, 6], iv = (twice, 34), v = 34.0))\n[1, 2]\n34\n[5, 6]\n34\n34.0\n(i = nothing, ii = nothing, iii = nothing, iv = (nothing, nothing), v = nothing)\n\njulia> d1 = Dict(\"x\" => [1,2], \"y\" => 3);\n\njulia> d2 = Dict(\"x\" => [4,5], \"y\" => 6, \"z\" => \"an_extra_value\");\n\njulia> fmap(+, d1, d2) == Dict(\"x\" => [5, 7], \"y\" => 9) # Note that \"z\" is ignored\ntrue\n\nMutable objects which appear more than once are only handled once (by caching f(x) in an IdDict). Thus the relationship x.i === x.iv[1] will be preserved. An immutable object which appears twice is not stored in the cache, thus f(34) will be called twice, and the results will agree only if f is pure.\n\nBy default, Tuples, NamedTuples, and some other container-like types in Base have children to recurse into. Arrays of numbers do not. To enable recursion into new types, you must provide a method of functor, which can be done using the macro @functor:\n\njulia> struct Foo; x; y; end\n\njulia> @functor Foo\n\njulia> struct Bar; x; end\n\njulia> @functor Bar\n\njulia> m = Foo(Bar([1,2,3]), (4, 5, Bar(Foo(6, 7))));\n\njulia> fmap(x -> 10x, m)\nFoo(Bar([10, 20, 30]), (40, 50, Bar(Foo(60, 70))))\n\njulia> fmap(string, m)\nFoo(Bar(\"[1, 2, 3]\"), (\"4\", \"5\", Bar(Foo(\"6\", \"7\"))))\n\njulia> fmap(string, m, exclude = v -> v isa Bar)\nFoo(\"Bar([1, 2, 3])\", (4, 5, \"Bar(Foo(6, 7))\"))\n\nTo recurse into custom types without reconstructing them afterwards, use fmapstructure.\n\nFor advanced customization of the traversal behaviour, pass a custom walk function that subtypes Functors.AbstractWalk. The form fmap(walk, f, x, ys...) can be called for custom walks. The simpler form fmap(f, x, ys...; walk = mywalk) will wrap mywalk in ExcludeWalk then CachedWalk.\n\njulia> struct MyWalk <: Functors.AbstractWalk end\n\njulia> (::MyWalk)(recurse, x) = x isa Bar ? \"hello\" :\n                                            Functors.DefaultWalk()(recurse, x)\n\njulia> fmap(x -> 10x, m; walk = MyWalk())\nFoo(\"hello\", (40, 50, \"hello\"))\n\njulia> fmap(MyWalk(), x -> 10x, m)\nFoo(\"hello\", (4, 5, \"hello\"))\n\nThe behaviour when the same node appears twice can be altered by giving a value to the prune keyword, which is then used in place of all but the first:\n\njulia> twice = [1, 2];\n\njulia> fmap(float, (x = twice, y = [1,2], z = twice); prune = missing)\n(x = [1.0, 2.0], y = [1.0, 2.0], z = missing)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/#Functors.@functor","page":"API","title":"Functors.@functor","text":"@functor T\n@functor T (x,)\n\nAdds methods to functor allowing recursion into objects of type T, and reconstruction.
