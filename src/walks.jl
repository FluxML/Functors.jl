    AbstractWalk

Any walk for use with [`fmap`](@ref) should inherit from this type.
A walk subtyping `AbstractWalk` must satisfy the walk function interface:
```julia
struct MyWalk <: AbstractWalk end

function (::MyWalk)(recurse, x, ys...)
  # implement this
end
```
The walk function is called on a node `x` in a Functors tree.
It may also be passed associated nodes `ys...` in other Functors trees.
The walk function recurses further into `(x, ys...)` by calling
`recurse` on the child nodes.
The choice of which nodes to recurse and in what order is custom to the walk.

    execute(walk, x, ys...)

Execute a `walk` that recursively calls itself, starting at a node `x` in a Functors tree,
